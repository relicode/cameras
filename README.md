# Cameras

Tiny, `node.js` application for displaying simultaneous IP camera feeds. This was made mostly to test singele executable app. Since the entire approach is experimental, hacky and there's no immediate way to include imported dependencies the SEA approach was dropped.

## Prerequisites

Runtime: [mpv](https://mpv.io/)
Developing: fairly modern NodeJS (see `.nvmrc` for exact version)

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Running
```sh
npm start
```
